# Turtle Graphics Flower Pattern

## Description
This Python script uses the `turtle` module to create an evolving, colorful flower-like pattern. The pattern is drawn using a loop that gradually changes parameters such as color, rotation angle, and circle radius, resulting in an artistic and visually appealing design. The script features a mode-switching mechanism that alternates between different shapes for each loop, adding variety to the generated patterns.

## Features
- Uses the HSV color model for smooth color transitions.
- Alternates between two pattern modes every 100 iterations.
- Clears the screen periodically to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Runs indefinitely, creating an evolving display of patterns.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, run the script in your terminal or command prompt:

`python3 graph.py`
